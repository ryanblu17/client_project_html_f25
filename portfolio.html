        <h2> Preparing for a Coaching Session </h2>
        <p>Career coaching is a collaborative process that empowers students with the knowledge and confidence to take the next steps in their career journey. Appointments are tailored to address your individualized career goals and the challenges you're facing.</p>

Through career coaching, coaches will challenge students, provide a safe space to try new things, and be by students’ side to celebrate their success.  </p>
